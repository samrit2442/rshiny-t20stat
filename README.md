Performance Analysis Dashboard Project

The R Shiny App T20performR is intended to attract cricket enthusiasts who wish to accumulate every bit of information about their favourite players. This is an open-source encyclopaedia of cricketers those who are cricbees and have an analytical mindset. The work is designed to demonstrate the performance analysis of T20I cricketers statistically, whereas exploratory data analysis and visualisation tools provide the key insights of them. Not only it will capture the individual performances of the cricket stars at the granular level just by selecting them from the dropdown menu but also it equips the comparative study of multiple cricketers by some appropriate metrics. The summary statistics of batting and bowling of the individuals are displayed separately on two pages. This dashboard is based on the ball-by-ball data from the website cricsheet filtered by T20 International matches for men only. The dataset is updated in the backend on every final day of each month. The algorithm uses the necessary R libraries (packages) as well as the scratch codes to process the assimilated data and the required analysis.
